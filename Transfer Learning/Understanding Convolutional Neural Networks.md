## Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks

So far we've seen that CNN's perform really well at classifying images. However, at this point, we don't really know how these CNN's actually work. If we could understand what a CNN is actually learning, then in principle, we should be able to improve it even further. One way to try to understand CNNs is by visualizing the convolutional layers. We encourage you to look at the link below to learn more about how to visualize convolutional layers:
