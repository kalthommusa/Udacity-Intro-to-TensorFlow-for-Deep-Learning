## Exercise: Flowers with Transfer Learning

Now is your turn to apply transfer learning to create your own CNN to classify images of flowers. We will provide you with a Colab to guide you through the creation and training of your CNN. This time you will have to download the Flowers dataset yourself using TensorFlow Datasets and split it into a training and validation set. We will provide a separate Colab with our solution, so that you you can compare your answers to ours.

We strongly suggest that you write all the code yourself and not to copy and paste the code from other Colabs. At the end of the Colab we encourage you to perform transfer learning using the Inception model and compare the accuracy of this model with MobileNet.

Have fun!
