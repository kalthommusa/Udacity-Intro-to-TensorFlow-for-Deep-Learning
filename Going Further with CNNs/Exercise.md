## Exercise: Classify Images of Flowers

Now is your turn to apply everything you learned in this lesson to create your own CNN to classify images of flowers. We will provide you with a Colab to guide you through the creation and training of your CNN. In the Colab we will download the Flowers dataset for you and separate it into training and validation sets. We will also provide a separate Colab with our solution, so that you you can compare your answers to ours.

We strongly suggest that you write all the code yourself and not to copy and paste the code from other Colabs. At the end of the Colab we encourage you to have fun and experiment with different model architectures and parameters to see if you can increase your accuracy.

Have fun!
