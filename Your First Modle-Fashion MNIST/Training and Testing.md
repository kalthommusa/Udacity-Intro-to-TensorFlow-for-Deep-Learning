## [TensorFlow Datasets](https://medium.com/tensorflow/introducing-tensorflow-datasets-c7f01f7e19f3) provides a collection of datasets ready to use with TensorFlow.

Datasets are typically split into different subsets to be used at various stages of training and evaluation of the neural network. In this section we talked about:

Training Set: The data used for training the neural network.
Test set: The data used for testing the final performance of our neural network.
The test dataset was used to try the network on data it has never seen before. This enables us to see how the model generalizes beyond what it has seen during training, and that it has not simply memorized the training examples.

In the same way, it is common to use what is called a Validation dataset. This dataset is not used for training. Instead, it it used to test the model during training. This is done after some set number of training steps, and gives us an indication of how the training is progressing. For example, if the loss is being reduced during training, but accuracy deteriorates on the validation set, that is an indication that the model is memorizing the test set.

The validation set is used again when training is complete to measure the final accuracy of the model.
